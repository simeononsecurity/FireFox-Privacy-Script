# FireFox Privacy Script

**Work in progress**

Organizations like [PrivacyTools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/browsers/#about_config) and [ffprofile](https://ffprofile.com/) have suggested changes to make FireFox more secure and private.
These changes cover suggested browser extentions, blocking telemetry, disabling 3rd-party cookies, disabling trackers, etc.

This script will take the pregenerated FireFox configuration files and install them in the proper directories on a Windows system.
